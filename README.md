## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was the first time I was using CSS Grid. Although I'm still trying to get to grips with it, I do like how simple it is to make elements responsive using `grid-template-areas` and `grid-area`.

Another bit of use ful code that I learnt was `overflow: hidden`. This made the background colors easily conform to the border radius set on the container.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing CSS Grid, so that I'm comfortable using both it and Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [The Free Tutorial Centre](https://resource-centre.net/css3-tutorials/turning-links-into-buttons/) - This helped me change my HTML slightly to make styling buttons with an anchor tag easier.
